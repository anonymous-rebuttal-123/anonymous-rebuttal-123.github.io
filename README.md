# 2. How Does PFSA Work?
The role of PFSA is manifested in two aspects:

***(i) adjusting the variance and intensity across different frequency bands***: during the early and middle stages of denoising, PFSA amplifies the high-frequency signal intensity of the latent representation and increases the variance, while in the later stages of denoising, it reduces the high-frequency signal intensity and decreases the variance;

***(ii) Clustering effect***: It has the ability to cluster tokens into several categories.
